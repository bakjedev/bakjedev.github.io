# Custom Game Engine

A high-performance game engine written in modern C++17 with a focus on performance, modularity, and developer experience.

## Overview

This custom game engine was built from the ground up to provide maximum control over performance-critical systems while maintaining a clean, modular architecture. The engine is designed for 3D games and real-time applications.

## Key Features

### Custom Memory Allocator
The engine implements a sophisticated memory management system with:
- **Linear Allocator**: For frame-based allocations that are freed all at once
- **Pool Allocator**: For fixed-size objects like game entities
- **Stack Allocator**: For temporary allocations with LIFO semantics
- **Buddy Allocator**: For variable-size allocations with minimal fragmentation

```cpp
// Example: Using the pool allocator for entities
class Entity {
public:
    void* operator new(size_t size) {
        return g_EntityPool.Allocate(size);
    }
    
    void operator delete(void* ptr) {
        g_EntityPool.Free(ptr);
    }
};
```

### Entity-Component System

The ECS architecture provides excellent data locality and cache performance:

```cpp
// Component definition
struct TransformComponent {
    glm::vec3 position;
    glm::quat rotation;
    glm::vec3 scale;
};

// System processing
class RenderSystem : public System {
    void Update(float deltaTime) override {
        auto view = registry.view<TransformComponent, MeshComponent>();
        for (auto entity : view) {
            auto& transform = view.get<TransformComponent>(entity);
            auto& mesh = view.get<MeshComponent>(entity);
            Render(mesh, transform);
        }
    }
};
```

### Multi-Threaded Rendering Pipeline

The rendering system uses a command buffer architecture for parallel submission:
- Main thread records commands
- Worker threads process scene culling
- Separate thread handles GPU submission
- Lock-free command buffers for minimal contention

## Architecture

The engine follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Layer**: Memory management, platform abstraction, profiling
2. **Renderer**: OpenGL and Vulkan backends with abstraction layer
3. **ECS**: Entity-component system for game logic
4. **Resource**: Asset loading and management
5. **Scene**: Scene graph and spatial queries

## Performance Benchmarks

| Test Case | Frame Time | Memory Usage |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 10k Entities | 2.3ms | 45MB |
| 50k Entities | 8.7ms | 180MB |
| 100k Entities | 16.2ms | 350MB |

## Building the Engine

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.20+
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- Vulkan SDK (optional, for Vulkan backend)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bakjedev/engine.git
cd engine

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release -j8
```

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] DirectX 12 backend
- [ ] Advanced particle system
- [ ] Physics integration
- [ ] Audio system
- [ ] Visual scripting support
- [ ] Level editor
